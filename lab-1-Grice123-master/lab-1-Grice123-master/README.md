# Lab 1 instructions

***
## Prerequisites
Software Installation [guide](https://udel.instructure.com/courses/1539549/files/87711831?module_item_id=18951427)

Note: Installing JavaFX from steps 3 and 4 of the guide above is not necessary until Lab2. Come to lab on week 2 with javaFX installed and ready to go.

Git: there are resources attached at the bottom of this README that will help you understand Git

***

Go through [this](https://github.com/vgutta/CISC275-Lab1-StarterCode/blob/master/JUnit4.pdf) file on JUnit testing.

The code for `add()` method and its corresponding tests are provided in the starter code above.

Clone this repository locally on your computer. Open the project in eclipse. And run the MathTest.java file.

*Note: One of the test cases provided fails and must be fixed. See instructions below.*

### Your task for Lab 1: 
1. The JUnit test named `testAdd2()` currently fails. Fix the assertion to make the test pass. 
2. Push your code to Github(refer to links on Git below). 
3. If you did this correctly you should see your updated code for here on the Github website in your repo for Lab1. 
4. Then go to the Actions tab of your repo to check whether your latest commit passed the automated tests.
5. Create a `multiply()` method that takes in two integers as parameters and then returns the product of those. Write a corresponding JUnit test for `multiply()` in MathTest.java. Repeat steps 2-4 above.

### Submission
You are done when you complete the steps 1-5 above and if the automated tests pass.
